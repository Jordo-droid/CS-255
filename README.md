**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The DriverPass project was for the owners of DriverPass Liam and Ian. The system is designed to allow customers to access study/exam material for liscence testing. The system also offers on the road training for customers to sign up for. Using various roles, the system allows for management of user profiles, available material and packages, and appointments for OTR training.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I think with this project I did a good job of converting the requirements for the project into the various diagrams that I had created.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to add more detail to the UML sequence diagram. I do not have access to the paid version of LucidChart and was met with a shape limit during the creation of my UML Sequence diagram. There are a few more loop options and use cases that I would like to point out within the Sequence Diagram.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Interpreting the user's needs is all about listening directly to what the client wants. The document used to outline the meeting with the owners of DriverPass provided excellent detail on how they wanted the system to be handled, what kind of security options they were looking for, and what primary capabilities the system needed to have. All of this information is gained by listening to the user's needs and is the primary factor into making decisions for coding the application.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I think it's important to layout the goals for the software before beginning development. Using UML diagrams to label all of the use cases and system requirements helps give a better idea of what you need to accomplish with the given system and how long development could take.
